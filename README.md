Computer framework to store and evaluate likelihoods coming from High Energy Physics experiments. Due to its flexibility it can be interfaced with existing fitting codes and allows to uniform the interpretation of the experimental results among the users. The code is provided with large open database, which contains the experimental measurements. The code is of use for users who perform phenomenological studies, global fits or experimental averages.
